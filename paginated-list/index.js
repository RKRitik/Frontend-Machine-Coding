// First interview was to code a paginated widget of Addresses. Imagine you are a seller with a list of address you ship to an need to view them 5 address per page, with the possibility to go previous and next. Interviewer was really kind and made me focus on important bits. Which are the logic for disbaling and enabling previous and next button depending on data size. CSS for the layouts, Data and props modelling.
